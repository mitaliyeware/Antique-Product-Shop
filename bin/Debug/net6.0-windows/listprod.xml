The portrait of the Gentleman is available separately. Can be purchased together. Interested? Let me know. I particularly like the reserved composure of the lady, but shown with a softness and kindness coming through her face, clearly the artist was trying to capture this with in the portrait. The details around the eyes draw you in and her mouth, I think, is restraining from a smile while comfortably sitting with her arm rested on the chair arm. Very nice detail to the broach and ring on her finger. The frame is very old and showing its age and bears a label with an address in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. Sadly we haven't been able to find a signature.</description><ImagePath>Images/2.jpg</ImagePath><Bought_from>Emma Walton</Bought_from><Bought_on>0001-01-01T00:00:00</Bought_on></Product><Product><ID>2</ID><name>Oil Painting Still Life Flowers</name><price>899</price><originPeriod>0</originPeriod><origin>Dutch</origin><ImagePath>Images/3.jpg</ImagePath><Bought_on>0001-01-01T00:00:00</Bought_on></Product><Product><ID>4</ID><name>Walnut Sculpture of Madonna Seated on Throne </name><price>2599</price><originPeriod>0</originPeriod><origin>French</origin><ImagePath>Images/5.jpg</ImagePath><Bought_on>0001-01-01T00:00:00</Bought_on></Product><Product><ID>5</ID><name>Liberty Style Leather Elephant</name><price>599</price><originPeriod>0</originPeriod><origin>British</origin><ImagePath>Images/6.jpg</ImagePath><Bought_on>0001-01-01T00:00:00</Bought_on></Product><Product><ID>6</ID><name>Bronze Figure of Ganesha</name><price>1199</price><originPeriod>0</originPeriod><origin>Asian</origin><ImagePath>Images/7.jpg</ImagePath><Bought_on>0001-01-01T00:00:00</Bought_on></Product><Product><ID>7</ID><name>Spelter Elephant Group</name><price>599</price><originPeriod>0</originPeriod><origin>French</origin><ImagePath>Images/8.jpg</ImagePath><Bought_on>0001-01-01T00:00:00</Bought_on></Product><Product><ID>8</ID><name>Liverpool Made Regulator Wall Clock</name><price>1399</price><originPeriod>1930</originPeriod><origin>English</origin><height_width>53cm*40cm</height_width><condition>Georgian Antiques has clarified that the Liverpool Made Regulator Wall Clock (LA398614) is genuinely of the period declared with the date/period of manufacture being c.1840</condition><description>This is a quality mahogany cased drop dial regulator clock by ‘T.
